Perl Dancer based CMS

This CMS is for my own use, however, if anyone can & want to use it, please be my guest.

A couple of things you need to know before using this CMS.

- In dev stage.
- No guarantee whatsoever.
- Uses Miyagawa's awesome CPANM & Carton.
- Based on Perl Dancer, no intentions to upgrade to Dancer2 for now.
- Uses Moose & DBIX::Class.
- Makes use of numerous CPAN modules, be prepared to install them.
- Uses Twitter Bootstrap & Jquery for the nice web stuff.
